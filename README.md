# Maelstrom2

This project is dedicated to the remake of classic MacOS game Maelstrom by Ambrosia Software. 
Builds are planned for MacOS x86 and ARM, along with Windows and eventually iOS. The game is being developed using Unity Game Engine.

There are many things sill needing to be finished, including animation logic, textures and UI images, Sprites, and some extra scripting for some game events
such as Super Novas, New Gamma Ray bursts events, Black holes, and X/times score multplier coins.


Features near completeion:
Canisters - these hold ammo upgrades much like the original, plus shield refill.
Enemy Logic - Scripts are finished to handle the three types of ET enemy Craft logic.
Player Mechanics - Scripts are nearly finished to handle respawn, location, and status updates.

The scripts in the repo are about 90% finished with some missing logic for future mechanics.

Features not worked on yet:
Settings UI panel, though it exists it is not finsihed and has zero logic written.
Animations
Sprites
UI design

As of right now I am only including the scripts for people to disect and pick apart, I will add a build folder with the project's assests
once the project is easier to maintain.

The project is still in it's infancy but is being constantly worked on by myself. Feel free to modify these scripts and report back if you wish.
If you would like to help contribute to the project I am always looking for help. I can give the full project build files per request, but as of right now they are not 
tangable enough to put up here without a full explaination of the game objects and their structure within Unity.

All contributors to the project development will be credited in the final release. Currently A development build is in the works and a release can be expected within
the next few months or faster if I can get game art finished faster.

This will be an open project to welcome all developers who hold a special place in their hears for the original Maelstrom game.
