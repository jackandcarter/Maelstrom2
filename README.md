# Maelstrom2

This project is dedicated to the development of Maelstrom2, inspired by the classic MacOS game Maelstrom by Ambrosia Software. 
Builds are planned for MacOS Intel and Apple Silicon, along with Windows and eventually iOS. The game is being developed using Unity Game Engine and will feature updated graphics, smoother gameplay mechanics, new features, and transitions with many new game elements inspired by the original game. This readme is here to share the progress made so far.

There are a few things that still need to be finished, <BR><BR>but I'm happy to say the project is near it's fully functioning developer build :)

Asteroid animations and Spawn points are finished, Player ship movement, shield, and bullet/power up mechanics are complete. So far two of the new features have been implimented with a few more being added slowly as bugs are fixed. It's mostly sounds, some event animations, and Main menu that need work still.

Revision 3.zip - This file has the pre-built prefabs, complete functioning rev3 scripts, sprites, and some early development files now completed in Rev6.

Revision 3 Files are now being phased out into revision 6 pre developer build. Rev4 and Rev5 were for bug fixes and ui creation and didnt add any mechanic logic or finish any gameplay mechanics.

Rev 6.zip - This file includes the biggest update to the game and has a huge list of added mechanics and logic, mostly UI and and gameplay related. Major bugs are fixed but still a few left to work out, they will all be fixed in the Developer Build. Currently These files can replace the Revision 3 game object setup in the project hierarchy and delete or add the new script game objects as needed. A MacOS build of Rev6 will be available shortly to show the progression of the development and it's updated graphics.
